In the United States, "77% of adults owned a smartphone in 2017", according to a study by Pew Research. For an increasing number of people, their smartphone is their primary tool to access the innumerable services on the internet. Our electronic devices, personal computers are well as smartphones, are ubiquitous, and we are using them to replace other tools for more and more tasks, like accessing books and other educational information, job-searching, health-and-wellness evaluation, and even finding love (Perrin).

So the average person heavily depends on their device(s). Unsurprisingly, this dependence is reflected in the "$4 Billion" that Americans spent in 2018 to have phones repaired. This number is higher than it needs to be, due to the actions of large companies to make consumers pay more to repair their devices, both to increase revenue from the repair business and also to incentivise consumers to replace their devices with new ones sooner (Industry Market Research...).

Besides the inconvenience and hardship consumers are faced with when their devices are rendered unusable, environmental damage from broken and discarded electronics is at an all-time high. According to the Global E-Waste Monitor, an organization created by the United Nations University along with other partner organizations, the United States generated "6.29 Million Tons of e-waste in 2016, out of 44 million tons globally." Those numbers are increasing. In fairness, E-Waste cannot be blamed solely on planned obsolescence but a general attitude among consumers that replacing is better than repairing and re-using drives this tremendous growth that is harmful to both the environment and the wider economy, and this cultural attitude is what allows planned obsolescence to exist so ubiqituously (Satyro et al; Balde et al).

So, what can be done to reduce the multitude of environmental, economic, and personal issues that are caused by our broken devices?
