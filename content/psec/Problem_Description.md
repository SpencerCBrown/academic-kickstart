**Today**, we use our phones for everything. <br>
More generally, we are more dependent on many kinds of technology than in the past. This certainly shouldn't be painted as a bad thing; throughout human history technology has advanced and we have been better off for it.

However, {{< hl >}}the key distinction between today's computer technology and the tools of the past is the scale{{< /hl >}}. 
According to Pew Research, up to 50% of the the 77% of adults in the United States that own a smartphone put them to various uses, such as job searching, online dating, shopping, and reading (Perrin).

## The State of Affairs
Technology is able *do* exponentially more than it ever has before, and this is directly correlated with the unfortunate fact that its complexity is exponentially greater than ever before. This leads to a couple of related problems:

1. As technology grows more complex and it becomes increasingly difficulty for anyone, even professionals, to comprehend the design and use of all the different available technologies in context, specialization of tech-workers into different areas of focus is required.

2. Due to companies pouring more resources into design and engineering to stay competitive in a consumer electronics market with ever-narrowing margins, they feel the need to maximize profit by stretching the revenue from each model of the device whenever possible.

The specialization is simply the cost of technological progress, and isn't all bad. Demand for specialization creates the opportunity for people who enjoy working in technology to grow to meet demand, and everyone can get something out of the situation. But this specialization means that the average person isn't going to be able to be able to easily firgure out, with no external guidance, how to maintain their devices, however beneficial that independence would be to them. This acts as an enabling factor for the 2nd issue.

Problem #2 may not seem like a big deal, and, in fairness, it doesn't have to be. Companies have a legitimate interest in trying to reap the benefits of their innovation; the problem arises when companies inhibit the aforementioned natural process of supply growing to meet demand in a larger ecosystem of products and third-party companies.

One modern example of this is Apple seizing imported replacement parts compatible with Mac and iPhone devices with the help of U.S. Customs, on the grounds that they are "counterfeit". This effectively ensures that they are the sole source of parts for repairing their devices - forcing third-party repair shops to agree to Apple's restrictive control to retain access to vital tools and components. (Gault & Coebler)

Another horrifying instance seems almost too dystopian to be real. Unfortunately, for Eric Lundgren a nightmare became *very* real. Eric Lundgren, a "electronics recycling enthusiast" was sentenced to over a year in federal prison after his prosecution by the DOJ at Microsoft's behest. His "crime" was creating and distributing disks containing installation media for the Windows operating system. (Jackman)

This media __cannot__ be used to install Windows on a computer without paying for a license, but rather can be used to restore windows to a working state on a broken or newly-fixed computer (for instance, if the hard drive was replaced). It can also be downloaded for free on most personal computer manufacturers' websites. 

His stated reason for his actions was to make it easier for electronics refurbishers and individuals to keep old computers running, saving them the hassle of finding and downloading, then installing the media onto a physical medium. So despite causing no monetary loss, Eric Lundgren was convicted for "trafficing" copyrighted materials, in a shocking abuse of the U.S. intellectual property system and a low blow from a microsoft that has seemed to be striving, in recent years, to improve its image from the aggressively monopolistic corporation it was in the 90s and 00s. (Jackman)

Instead of fostering, or at minimum allowing, these healthy ecosystems of third-party experts and do-it-yourself enthusiasts to develop around their products, they employ a variety of means to keep a monopoly on their product ecosystem. 
The ultimate cause of this anti-cooperative behavior is profit, incentivised by a {{< hl >}}"Bottom-Line at all costs" mentality.{{< /hl >}} 

The company can artificially charge more for repairs and maintenance if third-party competition for work on their product can't exist. If consumers simply give repair up as "too much of a hassle" or "not worth the cost", even better - then the company gets the revenue of a whole new device... __IF__ the customer can afford it, that is.

Companies accomplish this monopolistic control of their product in a few ways:

* Restriction of information about their products design and engineering
* Designing the product to be difficult or impossible to repair without risking further damage.
* Using (**and abusing**) intellectual-property laws to prevent individuals and third-parties from circumventing their control and creating an independent product ecosystem.

## The Consequences
In a survey I conducted on students in several classes at Kennesaw State University, 100% have, at some point, had their phones break.
{{<figure library="1" src="broken_stats.png" title="Figure 2.">}}

Out of these, 20% "quickly got it repaired".
{{<figure library="1" src="replacement.png" title="Figure 3">}}

The rest got it replaced, but not without the majority actually spending some time dealing with the inconvenience of a broken phone.

While the sample size here is not overly large nor the selection completely diversified, this makes a statement as to the benefits of having repair services available to consumers.

#### Personal/Lifestyle Consequences
Physical systems break down. That's just a simple fact of existing - specifically its the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

So some level of inconvenience is unavoidable when a device breaks, and we suddenly have to alter our routine to compensate. But some losses are worse than others. One of the uses for digital devices that some consumers value the most is storing priceless data, such as difficult-to-replace records, creative-works, or family photos.

A compounding of issues here creates the perfect storm. Since many people don't have the foresight to preemptively backup important data, when their device stops working they can only panic and search out someone who might possibly be able to retrieve their precious data. Thankfully, in many cases it's possible to recover data from the device; for instance, a broken phone screen usually leaves the memory undamaged.

However, in a world where the norm is to simply replace a device when it breaks, the skillset to perform this kind of service is rarer. Also, in some cases when manufacturers actually *do* provide some kind of repair services to customers (*usually at an inflated rate, or for some limited time*), the important data on the device can still be lost.

For instance, Apple's __*Genius Bar*__ often replaces phones with refurbished ones rather than go to the trouble of diagnosing and repairing a specific issue. As stated in their terms of services, they don't guarantee that data will be transferred to the new device. (Apple Legal)

#### Environmental Fallout

 As documented in "The Global E-Waste Monitor 2017", the amount of e-waste countries across the world produce is growing, and, despite regulations, only "20%" is collected and documented properly to be recycled as much as possible. Many of the materials in these discarded devices could have still been used, and the Monitor estimates the cost to produce new equivalent materials to be approximately "55 Billion Euros", and instead of being reused they are left abandoned to contribute to our current environmental issues. (Bald√©, et all)
 
 While the blame for e-waste cannot solely be directed to the practice of planned obsolescence, it certainly contributes to shortened device lifespans. By definitions, shorter devices lifespans increase the number of devices being discarded, increasing the majority of devices that are not recycled properly.

#### Other Social and Economic Consequences

Finally, planned obsolescence has some unexpected impacts on other issues in our society. 

Economically, the wasted raw materials mentioned in the section on environmental effects are worth a huge amount of money - money that is lost when companies have to spend huge sums to mine more raw materials.  Also, as arises in any situation where large corporations manipulate the legal and political system to their own advantage, the smaller business that could be part of a thriving repair industry are harmed.

Perhaps even more concerning is that shorter products lifespans due to planned obsolescence disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, furthering the divide between those who can afford to continually replace products, for updated form or restored function, and those who must, due to economic circumstances, settle for using "obsolete or non-functional products" (Satyro et al).
