In weighing solutions, I think several categories are important to consider.

* __Effectiveness__

How completely does the solution address the problem of planned obsolescence and the associated effects. Is the solution just a stopgap that mitigates the undesired effects *or* does it represent a more cohesive approach to addressing the underlying cause?

* __Viability__

How likely are the proposed measured to be implemented? Are most reasonable people going to be convinced of the relevance of the solution? What will it cost (in a monetary, and larger sense)?

* __Consequences__

What undesired or unexpected consequences of implementing the solution be? Will it trade one problem for a set of new ones? For centralized, top-down solutions, will anyone's rights be neglected?

* __Rights/Freedoms__

Will anyone's rights be neglected? How much will it impact individual freedom for those affected by it? *Especially for centralized, top-down solutions.*

* __Duration__

How long will the solution be effective? Is it, as mentioned above, a short-term stopgap? Is it likely to be weakened over time, perhaps if people gradually forget life before the solution was implemented and allow the problem to re-occur? Otherwise, for a centralized top-down solution, is the solution too rigid to evolve as society changes in the future?
