## Option 1 - Top-Down Legislative Reform:
One possible solution to fix the current issues with our consumer electronics industry is regulatory action. This could take several forms, ranging from simply enforcing certain requirements on manufacturers to fixing the errors, ambiguities, and inequalities in the U.S. intellectual property system. Examples do exist; the Right to Repair movement advocates for a mix of these two strategies.

The Repair Association has defines a list of goals for improvements in the consumer electronics industry, and describes the legislation that could make that happen. These goals include enabling consumers to be able to (with reasonable effort/cost/time) "access the information and tools that would enable them, or a third party" to fix and "extend the lifespan of their products", rather than be forced to replace them. (Repair Association)

The proposed legislative changes, simplified, would require manufacturers to:

1. Make schematics and other design documentation available for free or a fair price
2. Make replacement parts and tools to install them equally available to affiliated and non-affiliated parties.
3. Legalize manipulating and modifying the software and firmware installed on the device (currently against the DCMA).
(Repair Association)

While these changes are being advocated in the United States, the impacts could have global repercusisons. Recently, the European Union passed the GDPR regulations, which impose restrictions on the information websites and online services can collect on EU citizens. Despite this only being in effect in the EU, it has been speculated that some services, to avoid the effort of maintaining separate regional sites, may elect to follow GDPR laws for all users.

This regulation would effectively end the monopoly that current consumer electronics corporations have over their devices, and restore many of the rights that consumers have lost over their own property. It would open up the repair industry to healthy competition, and allow consumers more choice in how they maintain their devices. 

Ultimately it would be a very good thing, and it would seem to not even affect real innovation in a overly negative way; instead it would push manufacturers to place more value on objectively innovative features and products instead of allowing them to nickle-and-dime customers for maintainence while paying lipservice to innovation by adding only gimmicks instead of real features to new devices and platforms. See figure 4, below - 80% of the college students surveyed thought new smartphones features didn't really justify the rate they are replaced.

## Option 2 - Bottom-Up Approach: Consumer Awareness, Education, and Open Source
As another alternative, while planned obsolescence is ubiquitous across the consumer electronics industry, there do exist some companies that are more supportive of consumer rights and the repair industry, such as Dell (as mentioned [here](https://ifixit.org/right)). An alternative to legislation would be to begin a consumer-centric campaign of education about the issues of planned obsolescence and monopolistic control of device repair. This campaign would then rely on consumers to, upon understanding the positive impact of a fairer, more competitive repair industry, collectively demand that manufacturers provide more opportunities for third-parties to perform device maintainence. 

This would also depend on enough consumers caring enough to avoid supporting companies that didn't support these ideals.

On its face, such a large, spontaneous effort might seem impossible, but such a movement isn't without precedent. Within a closely-related industry that has suffered many of the same problems of intellectual property misuse, the software industry has been radically changed over the past 2 decades due to the *Free and Open Source Software Movement* (FOSS). The open source movement started out as a inclination to share and collaborate in small groups of hobbyist developers, and slowly spread among industry insiders until it has become (almost) a household term. Today, Open Source, in one form or another, is the de-facto way to do software development - even in questionably-ethical megacorps, such as Facebook and Google. Open Source is a great example of how grassroots movements can grow to take the world by storm, even if they start small with a only a committed, passionate group of people pushing for change.

In fact, Open Source can serve as not only a model of the type of movement we would want for consumer electonics, but as a concrete way to enact change within the industry. In recent years, after the success of Open Source Software has become evident, more and more proposals for various types of Open Source Hardware designs have been suggested.

The Open Source Hardware model does have its problems. Even though both Open Source Software and Open Source Hardware are ultimately about sharing information, the products that that information is used to create is drastically different. Open Source Software is intangible in both design form and in the resulting product. For Open Source Hardware, the designs are intangible but the products are completely physical.

So many consumers feel the effects of premature failure of their appliances and devices, and if they were made aware of the root causes of their issues in a concrete way that illustrated a path to action, they would surely respond appropriately and the tech culture would slowly shift to more long-lasting products with less-centralized control of our devices.
