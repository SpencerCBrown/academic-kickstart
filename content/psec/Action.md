So...

What can we do as consumers to work towards a better system of consumer electronics design, sale, and disposal?

The best possible action on our part is to spread awareness among our friends and communities that the inconveniences and problems we face due to planned obsolescence are not neccessary for our technologically-immersed existence to continue. We need to choose, other factors being equal, companies that support and represent these ideals, and we need to be vocal about our belief that governmental policies that enable companies to continue impeding change must be abolished, replaced instead with clear, fair, and beneficial legislation that constructs a clear path forward to sustainable and free-spirited computing.
