Today's world of technological connection requires devices to enable us biologically-bound creatures to access the vast world of information and services made available by countless companies and organizations across the globe. A growing trouble in paradise, however, is the planned obsolescence that has become ubiquitous across the consumer electronics industry that develops such devices. 

This planned obsolescence exacerbates existing issues such as social inequality and environmental damage, as well as creating its own problems such as inconvenience and loss-of-control for consumers. Rather than consumers choosing what they do with their own devices, companies make ultimatums that control the use of technology through the threat of legal action or withholding maintenance.

Possible resolutions for these problem include amending the laws and regulations that enable this destructive behavior, and adopting a better mindset as consumers that thinks of technological devices less as continually-replaced novelties that are provided by the manufacturers, and more as long-lasting tools for which we should __demand__ better longevity and support.

Ultimately, the situation is hopeful. As more and more people become concerned about the environmental and societal impacts of computing, awareness about the problems with planned obsolescence (and, more generally, all kinds of intellectual property misuse) allows a chance for radical and positive change to finally occur.
