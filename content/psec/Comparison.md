Both of the proposed solutions would be good ones, but upon consideration with the proposed criteria, one slightly edges forward as a practical, recommended solution.

### Effectiveness and Viability

Both the proposed solutions seem to thoroughly address the issues with planned obsolescence and consumer electronics, so a consideration of the viability of both solutions is very closely related to the ultimate effectiveness.

Legislative Reform, in the manner described by the Fair Repair Association, would be very effective in changing the industry to better support the repair industry, and encourage companies to design longer-lasting products. The major negative consideration here is that large corporations wield a great deal of influence in the American political system, and so there might be some resistance to implementing legislation that meets the ideals proposed. Incorrectly focused, badly though-out laws might be worse than the current status quo. The U.S. certainly doesn't have the best [track record](https://alj.artrepreneur.com/mickey-mouse-keeps-changing-copyright-law/) when it comes to companies wanting to dictate IP law.

A grass-roots, bottom-up movement of awareness and market-based influence, and centered on Open Source Hardware, would also effectively solve the problem, in a way that would be sure to most accurately reflect what the priorities of actual consumers, rather than the inherent caricatures and generalizations that arise in the lobbying process. The problem here is that there is an unavoidable risk that the movement would never reach the inflection point that Open Source did, instead dying out without producing any positive change. This is exacerbated by the fact that Open Source Hardware is a very new idea and will doubtlessly face a number of difficulties in its path to mainstream adoption.

I think, taking all this into consideration, legislation reform has shown to have some considerable momentum in recent years with the Right to Repair movement making headway in several areas of law, so it can be considered slightly higher in effectiveness & viability than the grassroots option.

### Consequences, Rights, and Freedoms

A grassroots, bottom-up movement would seem to be the clear winner for this criterion, since it doesn't involve the use of governmental interference to create a large impact on the problem. However, rather than the Right to Repair movement being yet-another regulation, it can be seen as a legislative adjustment to misuses of existing laws and protections. 

If implemented correctly, with forethought and care, it could address the issues and abuses of the current consumer electronics status quo without harming innovation or unduly infringing on the ability of technology entrepeneurs and companies to continue to make their living. As mentioned in the description of the first solution, it could even encourage companies to focus more on objective innovation, rather than putting more resources into relying on existing products to continue to produce recurring revenue.

Below is an excellent perspective on the benefits of right to repair, from an industry insider.

While the grassroots in a sure option for minimizing unwanted negative consequences from the systematic changes to the status quo, Right to Repair is by no means an unreasonable or overbearing option.

### Duration
Both solutions could conceivably last indefinitely, although both are in danger of losing effectiveness over time, for different reasons.

Fair Repair changes to legislation could, obviously, be eventually rolled back or legally circumvented given enough time and a sufficient shift in public opinion of the issue, but as noted when discussing viability for legislative reform, existing law typically doesn't change quickly or easily.

Shifts in priorities among consumers would also be necessary for the grassroots movement to lose effectiveness over time, but wouldn't have the buffer of the difficulties of changing the law to contend with, so whether right or not, legislation would have a greater potential for longevity than a grassroots movement alone.

## Conclusion
<span style="font-size:larger;">
__My conclusion is that Fair Repair legislation is a good option for resolving the current problems with planned obsolescence and product control monopoly in the consumer electronics industry.__
